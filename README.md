## Overview

PhoneNow, a telecommunications company, conducted a churn analysis to assess the rate at which customers are leaving their service. Churn rate is a crucial metric that indicates the percentage of customers who discontinue their service within a given period. 
Importance of Understanding and Reducing Churn: 1).  High churn rates directly affect revenue. Acquiring new customers is typically more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, reducing churn helps maintain a stable revenue stream. 2). A high churn rate can damage the company's reputation. Customers are more likely to trust and recommend a company with low churn rates, contributing to long-term success.
